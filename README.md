## ✅ Recommendations

* **Optimize Pricing Tiers**
  Introduce mid-tier or region-specific pricing (e.g., ad-supported or mobile-only plans) to boost ARPU on LioCinema’s large free and Tier 2 segments without deterring volume.

* **Enhance Engagement**
  Leverage personalized content recommendations, push notifications, and targeted promotions to raise LioCinema’s average watch time closer to Jotstar’s levels.

* **Expand Content Library**
  Invest in additional language tracks and niche genres—particularly for LioCinema—to match Jotstar’s breadth and attract non–Tier 1 audiences.

* **Targeted Promotions**
  Use geo-demographic insights to run city-tier and age-group campaigns (e.g., student bundles for 18–24, family/corporate bundles for 25–34) to drive plan upgrades.

* **Retention Initiatives**
  Implement loyalty rewards, win-back offers, and proactive outreach during known downgrade peaks to reduce churn and stabilize subscription plans.
